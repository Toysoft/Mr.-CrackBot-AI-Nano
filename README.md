#Mr. CrackBot AI

> **Status**: 🚧 In its infancy – Not yet released!

Welcome to **Mr. CrackBot AI**, a cutting-edge tool designed for automated Wi-Fi penetration testing and password cracking. Currently in its early development stages, Mr. CrackBot AI combines artificial intelligence, GPU power, and modern cybersecurity techniques to push the boundaries of network security testing.

---

## 🚀 Features
Here’s what Mr. CrackBot AI aims to accomplish:
- **AI-Powered Wordlist Generation**: Uses machine learning to generate highly optimized password guesses based on network metadata.
- **Automated WPA Handshake Capture**: Scans networks and captures WPA/WPA2 handshakes with minimal user input.
- **GPU-Accelerated Cracking**: Leverages NVIDIA GPUs and tools like `hashcat` for lightning-fast password cracking.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Provides real-time updates on cracking progress and network analysis.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
To run Mr. CrackBot AI, you’ll need:
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4GB)**:
  - A small yet powerful AI development board.
- **Wi-Fi Adapter**:
  - Capable of monitor mode (e.g., ALFA AWUS036ACH).
- **NVIDIA GPU** (optional):
  - Enhances cracking speed if using external hardware.
- **SD Card**:
  - Minimum 32GB with Mr. CrackBot AI ISO installed.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Scanning Networks**:
   - The system uses `airodump-ng` to discover nearby Wi-Fi networks and identifies potential targets.

2. **Capturing Handshakes**:
   - Handshakes are captured using deauthentication attacks (`aireplay-ng`) and stored for analysis.

3. **AI-Powered Wordlists**:
   - Based on network metadata (SSID, BSSID), the AI generates custom wordlists optimized for cracking.

4. **GPU Cracking**:
   - The generated wordlist is run through `hashcat` for GPU-accelerated password cracking.
